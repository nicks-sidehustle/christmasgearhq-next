## Why Your Tree Stand Matters

A great Christmas tree stand does two things: keeps your tree upright and keeps it watered. Get this wrong, and you're dealing with a tilting tree, dried-out needles everywhere, or worse—a fire hazard.

We've reviewed the top stands based on stability, ease of setup, water capacity, and real-world durability.

## Best Overall: Krinner Tree Genie XXL

**Price:** $135.99 | **Rating:** ★★★★½ (4.6/5) | **10,900+ Reviews** | **#1 Best Seller**

The Krinner Tree Genie XXL is widely considered the gold standard of Christmas tree stands. Its unique foot-pedal clamping mechanism is what sets it apart—you can literally set up a full-size tree by yourself.

### Why It's Great
- **One-person setup:** The foot pedal tightens claws around the trunk. No crawling under the tree.
- **Rock-solid stability:** German engineering holds trees up to 12 feet without wobble.
- **1.3-gallon reservoir:** With water level indicator.
- **Handles trunk diameters from 1-6 inches.**

### The Downsides
- Premium price (~$136)
- Heavy at 13 lbs

**The Verdict:** Worth every penny. Buy it once, use it for decades.

**Incandescent:** Warmer glow, cheaper upfront.

**Our Take:** LED is worth it for safety and durability.
